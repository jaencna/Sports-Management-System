# 🏀 Sports Management System  
**A Web-Based Platform for Managing Teams, Matches, and Player Statistics**

---

## 📘 Overview

The **Sports Management System** is a web-based platform designed to help coaches and teams manage their sports data more efficiently. The system currently focuses on **basketball**, allowing users to manage players, track match scores, and monitor player stats. It uses **MySQL** as the backend database to store and retrieve all relevant data.

This platform is built with future scalability in mind, aiming to support multiple sports like **badminton**, **volleyball**, and more.
